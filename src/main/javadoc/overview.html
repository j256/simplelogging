<title>SimpleLogging Package Overview</title>

<body>
	<p>This package contains a small-ish library that backends to
a number of standard logging packages.  This allows you to write your
code and include log messages without having a fixed dependency on any
one logging package.  I include this code into my libraries and so
they can stay agnostic.  This allows you to write messages with the {}
support and then backend to a number of other logging libraries or you
can easily implement your own.
