#
# This file configures is one way you can configure your log backend.  It supports a line
# in the format of: 
#
# backend = type-or-class
#
# type-or-class can either be one of the enums in LogBackendType (ex: SLF4J) or a full class
# (ex: com.j256.simplelogging.backend.Slf4jLoggingLogBackend.Slf4jLoggingLogBackendFactory)
#
# Setting the global log level is also supported.  Setting it to NULL disables any previous calls to
# Logger.setGlobalLevel(...).
#
# global.level = INFO
#
# It also supports configuration for the LocalLogBackend in the format of:
#
# locallog.class-regex-pattern = level
#
# You should escape any period characters with a single backslash unless they are part of a regex match:
#
#   locallog.com\.j256\.simplelogging.* = DEBUG
#

# invalid lines that are ignored
something
field = value

# configure the backend through a LogBackendType enum value
backend = LOCAL
# can also be as a class name
# backend = com.j256.simplelogging.backend.Slf4jLoggingLogBackend.Slf4jLoggingLogBackendFactory

# increase the log level
locallog.com\.j256\.simplelogging\.LocalLogBackendTest = TRACE

# Set the global log level
# global.level = INFO
